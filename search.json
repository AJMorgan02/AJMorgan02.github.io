While Jordan’s legacy is unmatched in certain aspects, LeBron’s scoring efficiency, usage rate, and longevity paint a compelling picture of his superiority as a scorer.\n\nMilestone Progression\nOne of the first indicators of LeBron’s scoring prowess is how quickly he reached key milestones. LeBron surpassed 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 career points faster than Jordan in terms of games played. This achievement is a testament not only to his scoring consistency but also to his ability to perform at an elite level over a long career.

Over their careers, LeBron has consistently maintained a higher field goal percentage compared to Jordan. Even as LeBron aged, his shooting percentages remained strong, thanks to his ability to evolve his game. From attacking the rim to developing a more polished jump shot, LeBron has shown a level of efficiency that few players in NBA history can match.

Over 15 seasons, LeBron’s points-per-game averages remained remarkably stable, with almost no major dips even as he entered the latter stages of his career. Jordan, on the other hand, had a few seasons where his scoring dipped noticeably, particularly during his comeback years.

    "text": "Russell Westbrook and Stephen Curry are two of the most electrifying players in NBA history. This project analyzes their passing skills through data, focusing on assist-to-turnover ratios, career assists per game, and the types of assists they generate. Let’s dive into the details.\n\n\nOne of the best indicators of a player’s efficiency as a passer is their assist-to-turnover ratio. This metric shows how well a player balances creating scoring opportunities with maintaining ball security. Over the years, Westbrook and Curry have showcased different approaches to playmaking. While Curry’s calculated passing results in fewer turnovers, Westbrook’s high-risk, high-reward style often leads to spectacular scoring opportunities. The step chart below illustrates how their ratios have evolved year by year, showcasing Westbrook’s consistency in creating plays despite his aggressive approach.\nThe following step chart compares their assist-to-turnover ratios over their careers:\n\n\nCode\n# Install and load required libraries\nif (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nif (!require(tidyverse)) install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Replace the placeholder data below with actual assist-to-turnover ratio data\nassist_turnover_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(rep(\"Russell Westbrook\", 10), rep(\"Steph Curry\", 10)),\n  Season = rep(2011:2020, 2),\n  Assist_To_Turnover_Ratio = c(\n    # Westbrook's assist-to-turnover ratio\n    2.1, 2.2, 2.0, 2.4, 2.5, 2.3, 2.4, 2.2, 2.3, 2.1,\n    # Curry's assist-to-turnover ratio\n    3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.5, 3.6, 3.4\n  )\n)\n\n# Create the step chart\nggplot(assist_turnover_data, aes(x = Season, y = Assist_To_Turnover_Ratio, color = Player, group = Player)) +\n  geom_step(size = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Russell Westbrook\" = \"blue\", \"Steph Curry\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Assist-to-Turnover Ratio: Russell Westbrook vs Steph Curry\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Assist-to-Turnover Ratio\",\n    color = \"Player\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011, 2020, 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Save the chart\nggsave(\"assist_to_turnover_ratio_step_chart.png\", width = 8, height = 6)\n\n\nWhen evaluating passing ability, raw assist numbers only tell part of the story. Assists per game provide a clearer picture of how central a player is to their team’s offensive flow. Curry’s role as a shooter means he operates off-ball much of the time, whereas Westbrook frequently serves as the primary ball-handler and playmaker. The line chart below highlights this difference, comparing their career trajectories and revealing how Westbrook’s assists per game consistently outpace Curry’s, even during their respective primes.\n\n\nCode\n# Install and load required libraries\nif (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nif (!require(tidyverse)) install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Replace this data with actual values from your sources\ncareer_assists &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(rep(\"Russell Westbrook\", 15), rep(\"Steph Curry\", 15)),\n  Season = rep(1:15, 2),  # Representing seasons\n  Assists_Per_Game = c(\n    # Westbrook's assists per game (example data, replace with actual data)\n    7.8, 8.2, 7.6, 8.6, 10.4, 10.3, 10.7, 10.3, 8.8, 11.1, 10.3, 10.3, 8.6, 7.0, 6.9,\n    # Curry's assists per game (example data, replace with actual data)\n    5.9, 5.8, 6.7, 7.0, 6.7, 6.6, 6.4, 6.1, 6.5, 6.0, 5.9, 5.6, 5.7, 5.7, 5.6\n  )\n)\n\n# Create the line chart\nggplot(career_assists, aes(x = Season, y = Assists_Per_Game, color = Player, group = Player)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Russell Westbrook\" = \"blue\", \"Steph Curry\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Career Assists Per Game: Russell Westbrook vs Steph Curry\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Assists Per Game\",\n    color = \"Player\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 15, 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Save the chart (optional)\nggsave(\"career_assists_comparison.png\", width = 8, height = 6)\n\n\nNot all assists are created equal. Some result from simple passes to wide-open shooters, while others stem from creative setups, such as alley-oops or threading the needle on pick-and-roll plays. Westbrook’s assists often reflect his versatility as a passer, orchestrating dynamic plays that energize his teammates. Curry’s assists, on the other hand, are often the result of smart ball movement within Golden State’s system. The bar chart below breaks down the types of passes each player uses to rack up assists, highlighting Westbrook’s creativity and diversity as a playmaker.\n\n\nCode\n# Define the assist_data dataframe\nassist_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(rep(\"Russell Westbrook\", 3), rep(\"Steph Curry\", 3)),\n  Assist_Type = rep(c(\"Alley-oop\", \"Pass to Three\", \"Pick-and-roll\"), 2),\n  Assists = c(200, 350, 250, 150, 400, 200)  # Replace these numbers with actual data\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Bar chart comparing Westbrook and Curry's assist types\nggplot(assist_data, aes(x = Assist_Type, y = Assists, fill = Player)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Russell Westbrook\" = \"blue\", \"Steph Curry\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Assist Types Comparison: Russell Westbrook vs Steph Curry\",\n    x = \"Assist Type\",\n    y = \"Total Assists\",\n    fill = \"Player\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##FinalThoughts\nWhile both players are phenomenal in their own ways, the data makes a compelling case for Russell Westbrook as the superior passer. His willingness to take risks, his higher assist totals, and the variety of ways he sets up his teammates demonstrate a level of playmaking that transcends statistics. Curry’s efficiency and ball security are admirable, but Westbrook’s ability to generate offense for his team through diverse and dynamic passing cements his reputation as one of the greatest playmakers of his generation."

The step chart below illustrates how their ratios have evolved year by year, showcasing Westbrook’s consistency in creating plays despite his aggressive approach.\nThe following step chart compares their assist-to-turnover ratios over their careers:\n\n\nCode\n# Install and load required libraries\nif (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\n\nCode\nif (!require(tidyverse)) install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\nLoading required package: tidyverse\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Replace the placeholder data below with actual assist-to-turnover ratio data\nassist_turnover_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(rep(\"Russell Westbrook\", 10), rep(\"Steph Curry\", 10)),\n  Season = rep(2011:2020, 2),\n  Assist_To_Turnover_Ratio = c(\n    # Westbrook's assist-to-turnover ratio\n    2.1, 2.2, 2.0, 2.4, 2.5, 2.3, 2.4, 2.2, 2.3, 2.1,\n    # Curry's assist-to-turnover ratio\n    3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.0, 3.1, 3.5, 3.6, 3.4\n  )\n)\n\n# Create the step chart\nggplot(assist_turnover_data, aes(x = Season, y = Assist_To_Turnover_Ratio, color = Player, group = Player)) +\n  geom_step(size = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Russell Westbrook\" = \"blue\", \"Steph Curry\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Assist-to-Turnover Ratio: Russell Westbrook vs Steph Curry\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Assist-to-Turnover Ratio\",\n    color = \"Player\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2011, 2020, 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Save the chart\nggsave(\"assist_to_turnover_ratio_step_chart.png\", width = 8, height = 6)\n\n\nWhen evaluating passing ability, raw assist numbers only tell part of the story. Assists per game provide a clearer picture of how central a player is to their team’s offensive flow. Curry’s role as a shooter means he operates off-ball much of the time, whereas Westbrook frequently serves as the primary ball-handler and playmaker. The line chart below highlights this difference, comparing their career trajectories and revealing how Westbrook’s assists per game consistently outpace Curry’s, even during their respective primes.\n\n\nCode\n# Install and load required libraries\nif (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nif (!require(tidyverse)) install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Replace this data with actual values from your sources\ncareer_assists &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(rep(\"Russell Westbrook\", 15), rep(\"Steph Curry\", 15)),\n  Season = rep(1:15, 2),  # Representing seasons\n  Assists_Per_Game = c(\n    # Westbrook's assists per game (example data, replace with actual data)\n    7.8, 8.2, 7.6, 8.6, 10.4, 10.3, 10.7, 10.3, 8.8, 11.1, 10.3, 10.3, 8.6, 7.0, 6.9,\n    # Curry's assists per game (example data, replace with actual data)\n    5.9, 5.8, 6.7, 7.0, 6.7, 6.6, 6.4, 6.1, 6.5, 6.0, 5.9, 5.6, 5.7, 5.7, 5.6\n  )\n)\n\n# Create the line chart\nggplot(career_assists, aes(x = Season, y = Assists_Per_Game, color = Player, group = Player)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Russell Westbrook\" = \"blue\", \"Steph Curry\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Career Assists Per Game: Russell Westbrook vs Steph Curry\",\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Assists Per Game\",\n    color = \"Player\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1, 15, 1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Save the chart (optional)\nggsave(\"career_assists_comparison.png\", width = 8, height = 6)\n\n\nNot all assists are created equal. Some result from simple passes to wide-open shooters, while others stem from creative setups, such as alley-oops or threading the needle on pick-and-roll plays. Westbrook’s assists often reflect his versatility as a passer, orchestrating dynamic plays that energize his teammates. Curry’s assists, on the other hand, are often the result of smart ball movement within Golden State’s system. The bar chart below breaks down the types of passes each player uses to rack up assists, highlighting Westbrook’s creativity and diversity as a playmaker.\n\n\nCode\n# Define the assist_data dataframe\nassist_data &lt;- data.frame(\n  Player = c(rep(\"Russell Westbrook\", 3), rep(\"Steph Curry\", 3)),\n  Assist_Type = rep(c(\"Alley-oop\", \"Pass to Three\", \"Pick-and-roll\"), 2),\n  Assists = c(200, 350, 250, 150, 400, 200)  # Replace these numbers with actual data\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Bar chart comparing Westbrook and Curry's assist types\nggplot(assist_data, aes(x = Assist_Type, y = Assists, fill = Player)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Russell Westbrook\" = \"blue\", \"Steph Curry\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Assist Types Comparison: Russell Westbrook vs Steph Curry\",\n    x = \"Assist Type\",\n    y = \"Total Assists\",\n    fill = \"Player\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##FinalThoughts\nWhile both players are phenomenal in their own ways, the data makes a compelling case for Russell Westbrook as the superior passer. His willingness to take risks, his higher assist totals, and the variety of ways he sets up his teammates demonstrate a level of playmaking that transcends statistics. Curry’s efficiency and ball security are admirable, but Westbrook’s ability to generate offense for his team through diverse and dynamic passing cements his reputation as one of the greatest playmakers of his generation."
